- A JS built chatbot with numbered responses (added manually)
- Currently the responses are fetched from UtterancesArray, AnswersArray & AlternativesArray
- It can later be expanded to answer millions of questions by fetching the same from anyof the public APIs
- The chatBot returns responses based on the Array[i] currently which may later lead to heavy loads because of multiple looping among millions of responses
